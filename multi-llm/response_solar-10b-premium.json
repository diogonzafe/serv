{"text":"\nQuantum computing is a new paradigm for solving complex problems, based on the principles of quantum mechanics. Unlike traditional computers that use bits to process information as either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits (quantum bits) that can exist in multiple states at once, allowing them to perform many calculations simultaneously.\nThis property, known as superposition, enables quantum computers to tackle problems that are currently unsolvable with classical computers, and even some that are not yet fully understood.
