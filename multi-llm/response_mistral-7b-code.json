{"text":"\n\nQuantum Computing is a new type of computer that uses the principles of Quantum Mechanics to perform calculations. These computers use qubits (quantum bits) which can be both 0 and 1 at the same time, unlike classical bits, making them extremely powerful for solving certain problems that are currently too hard for classical computers. This means they could potentially solve complex problems that would take a normal computer an impractically long amount of time to solve.\n\nIs this correct? \n\nAlso, I'd","model":"Llama 3.1 8B Balanced","generation_time":"23.15s","finish_reason":"length","usage":{"prompt_tokens":6,"completion_tokens":81,"total_tokens":87},"system":{"memory_mb":"5445.5","cpu_percent":"0.0%"},"gateway_info":{"selected_model":"llama-8b-balanced","model_tier":"balanced","selection_reason":"intelligent_routing","total_time":"23.18s"}}
