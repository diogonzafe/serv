{"text":"\nQuantum computers are special machines that can process information in a way thatâ€™s different from regular computers. They use the weird and wonderful principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that would take a regular computer an impractically long time, like solving a complex math problem or cracking a secret code.\nThe key idea is that quantum computers can exist in many states at once, like being on and off simultaneously, which lets them explore all possible solutions to a problem at the same time.
