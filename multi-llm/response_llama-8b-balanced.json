{"text":" or less\nQuantum computing uses the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations that are exponentially faster than classical computers. This is achieved through the use of qubits (quantum bits) which can exist in multiple states at once, allowing for vast parallel processing. As a result, quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems that are currently unsolvable or require an unfeasible amount of time on classical computers.\nThe Future of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is transforming industries","model":"Llama 3.1 8B Balanced","generation_time":"23.84s","finish_reason":"length","usage":{"prompt_tokens":6,"completion_tokens":82,"total_tokens":88},"system":{"memory_mb":"5444.5","cpu_percent":"0.0%"},"gateway_info":{"selected_model":"llama-8b-balanced","model_tier":"balanced","selection_reason":"intelligent_routing","total_time":"23.87s"}}
